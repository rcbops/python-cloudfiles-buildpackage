This document describe how to make a release of python-cloudfiles.

  credentials account, please contact chmouel@chmouel.com if you don't
  have them.

- Packages for releases needed on system :

 * python-nose
 * python-epydoc

Steps
======


1) Run tests with nosetests and be sure it ends with OK or something is broken!

2) edit ChangeLog file and add an outline of the changes since the last release.

3) edit cloudfiles/consts.py and increase the version, following these rules :

   - Bugfixes -- increase the minor version.
   - Major features -- increase the major version.

4) Regenerate the docs with the command: epydoc --config=epydoc.conf

5) make sure you have only the relevant changes staged: git st

6) commit the changes: git commit -a

6) tag it with the new version:  git tag VERSION

7) push it to github : git push --tags origin master

9) if new features has been added (ie: new major release) upload the
   documentation by going in the docs directory and zip everything to
   a file like docs.zip and go to :

   (using rackspace credentials)
   
   and click on "choose file"" to that docs.zip and "upload documentation".
